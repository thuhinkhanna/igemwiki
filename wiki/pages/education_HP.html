{% block lead %}The team constantly kept asking ourselves how we can contribute to solving this problem that impacts every living being. To achieve this, we realized that the first step to solving the problem is creating the right awareness along with bio-engineering a solution that is cost-effective and accessible to everyone.{% endblock %}

<!-- 1. SBOA, Chennai 
As a part of our educational awareness program, one of the first schools that we visited was SBOA, Chennai. Here we had the opportunity to interact and educate 9th and 10th graders about the basics of synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and recent advancements in the field of biotechnology. We conducted a few fun-filled activities and experiments to keep the session engaging. The students had the opportunity to perform DNA extraction from tomatoes, concepts and experiments about food adulteration were performed and various streaking methods using color water were taught instead of going about the conventional way. After this, we gave a small sneak peek into the project that we are working on to the students, followed by which an entertaining Q&A took place. These students were extremely curious and the team had a great time with them.

2. SACRED HEART CHENNAI
 The 2nd school that we visited was Sacred Heart, Chennai. The students that we addressed were 12th graders from all respective streams. Since we had various groups of students, we decided to start from scratch and give a brief explanation from the basics of biology to genetic engineering and synthetic biology. Followed by this, we proceeded to speak to the students about iGEM and what it is that iGEM does. Fun activities involving various experiments were organized for the students to understand concepts about food adulteration, chromatography, and streaking methods using paint and watercolor. Finally, like the icing on a cake, a fun and enthralling activity “pipette art” was conducted. Students had the opportunity to learn how to handle the pipette correctly with care while they were busy bringing their art to life. This program aims to create a general awareness about the ongoing growth of biotechnology while making sure the students find the program helpful and entertaining.

 3. BHAVAN’S RAJAJI VIDYASHRAM, CHENNAI 
The BHAVAN’S school educational seminar will hold a special place in our hearts. We had the opportunity to interact with extremely inquisitive students. Right from the start of the session, the curiosity to learn and understand what is it that we iGEM teams are trying to do was observe. We had the opportunity to interact with 12th graders belonging to the biology with mathematics stream. What kept the session extremely lively was the genuine interest displayed by the students who seemed too eager to learn. -->

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution of synthetic biology projects. “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams' efforts to actively consider how the world affects their work and their work affects the world. Through your Human Practices activities, your team should demonstrate how you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your project is responsible and good for the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security, and sustainability of your project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your project purpose, design, and execution.</p>
    <p>Please note you can compete for the Silver Medal criterion #3, Gold Medal criterion #1 and the Best Integrated Human Practices prize with this page.</p>
    <p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://responsibility.igem.org/human-practices/what-is-human-practices">Human Practices Hub</a>.
    <p>On this page, your team should document all of your Human Practices work and activities. You should write about the Human Practices topics you considered in your project, document any activities you conducted to explore these topics (such as engaging with experts and stakeholders), describe why you took a particular approach (including referencing any work you built upon), and explain if and how you integrated takeaways from your Human Practices work back into your project purpose, design and/or execution.</p>
