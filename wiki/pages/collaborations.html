{% block lead %}Collaborations allow us to know about ourselves in a much better sense. Collaboration divides the tasks and multiplies the success. We had the opportunity to collaborate and interact with some of the most passionate and talented teams across the globe. Throughout this competition, we have had the occasion to understand and learn about each other’s project and synthetic biology, while exchanging knowledge that can help us elevate in our experimental work.{% endblock %}

            <br>    
            <p>
                iGEM is a scientific community that not only encourages healthy competition but also advocates and helps various teams all over the world, form bonds and connections. One of the many important ways of forming connections and helping science grow within this community is through the Mentor-Mentee program. We approached Team Munich to mentor us they had graciously accepted to mentor our team and guide us with our project.      
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Throughout the following months, we had weekly online meets that were extremely vital and important in helping us shape our project. Mr.Deepak Kumar (Advisor of Munich iGEM 2022 team) and the rest of his team engaged in discussions with our team members and shared their knowledge       
             </p>
            <br>
            <p> Our Sessions focused on: </p>
            <br>
            <ul style="margin-left: 1em;">
                <li><p>Team Munich guided and offered us suggestions that helped us enhance the quality of our plasmids during the course of its construction.</p></li>
                <li><p>The team provided their insights that helped us decide the suitable promoters needed for our project.</p></li>
                <li><p>They extended a helping hand in looking into our project troubleshoots related to plasmid expressions.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                We are extremely thankful to Mr. Deepak Kumar and the entire Munich iGEM 2022 team for their constant guidance and we hope to further strengthen our bonds in the future.

            <p>
                One of the collaborations that will remain closest to our hearts is the collaboration that was imitated by iGEM Team Netantis 2022. The idea behind the collaboration was to bring in members of our team in front of a water body and record them when they describe an emotion that they strongly feel when they are near the water body. The team members involved in this video were our beloved primary investigator, secondary investigator, our team instructor and our very own tech team member Thuhin Khanna and this video is taken in Elliots Beach, Chennai.
