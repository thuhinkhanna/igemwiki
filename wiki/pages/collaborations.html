{% block lead %}Collaborations allow us to know about ourselves in a much better sense. Collaboration divides the tasks and multiplies the success. We had the opportunity to collaborate and interact with some of the most passionate and talented teams across the globe. Throughout this competition, we have had the occasion to understand and learn about each otherâ€™s project and synthetic biology, while exchanging knowledge that can help us elevate in our experimental work.{% endblock %}

                iGEM is a scientific community that not oThe IIT Delhi Team had reached out to us and sent us some questions they had with regards to their project and asking some other general advice. We connected with our iHP Guide, Dr.Venkat and asked the questions sent by the IIT Delhi team. Dr.Venkat shared his insights and answered their questions. We noted down Dr.Venkat's response and shared those answers to themnly encourages healthy competition but also advocates and helps various teams all over the world, form bonds and connections. One of the many important ways of forming connections and helping science grow within this community is through the Mentor-Mentee program. We approached Team Munich to mentor us they had graciously accepted to mentor our team and guide us with our project.

                We had a virtual meeting with University of Waterloo's iGEM team to learn and discuss our respective projects. We had the privilege of getting to know the team and their project. We  engaged in a brain-storming session that helped us understand ways by which we can improve and raise the standards of our project. In return, we also provided the Waterloo team with some information that they can incorporate in their project.

                We had helped the Lamber_Ga iGEM team by curating a healthy cookbook containing super healthy and tasty recipes that represent our proud South Indian culture. Our team member, Abhitha, had helped in finding the perfect dish. Our chosen dishes are Medhu Vadai, Idiyappam and vegetable stew packed with South Indian magic, flavor and its mouth-watering aroma Medhu vadai is an ideal dish packed with protein, vitamin B and so many other essentials.
