<div id="AgaroseGelElectrophoresis" class="p-4 mb-4" style="background-color: #fcf5f7; border-radius: 20px;">
  <h3>Agarose Gel Electrophoresis <hr></h3>
  <h5>Materials Required :</h5>
  <p>
    1. TAE (EDTA, Acetate, Tris-base) <br>
    2. Agarose <br>
    3. Ethidium bromide <br>
    4. Casting tray <br>
    5. Well combs <br>
    6. Voltage source <br>
    7. Gel box <br>
    8. UV light source <br>
    9. Microwave
  </p>
  <h5>Procedure :</h5>
  <p>
    1. Make 1% Agarose Gel ( Mix 1g of Agarose powder with 100mL of 1X TAE buffer. <br>
    2. Microwave for 1-3 min until the agarose is completely dissolved. <br>
    3. Let the agarose solution cool down. <br>
    4. Add ethidium bromide (EtBr) to the agarose solution of approximately 0.2-0.5 μg/mL (usually about 2-3 μl of lab stock solution per 100 mL gel). EtBr binds to the DNA and allows you to visualize the DNA under ultraviolet (UV) light. <br>
    5. Pour the agarose into a gel tray with the well comb in place. <br>
    6. Let the agarose solution set. <br>
    7. Once solidified, place the agarose gel into the gel box (electrophoresis unit). <br>
    8. Fill the gel box with 1xTAE (or TBE) until the gel is covered. <br>
    9. Add loading buffer to each of your DNA samples.(Loading buffer serves two purposes: 1) it provides a visible dye that helps with gel loading and allows you to gauge how far the DNA has migrated; 2) it contains a high percentage of glycerol that increases the density of your DNA sample). <br>
    10. Carefully load a molecular weight ladder into the first lane of the gel. <br>
    11. Carefully load your samples into the additional wells of the gel. <br>
    12. Run the gel at 80-150 V until the dye line is approximately 75-80% of the way down the gel.Turn OFF power, disconnect the electrodes from the power source, and then carefully remove the gel from the gel box. <br>
    13. Using any device that has UV light, visualize your DNA fragments. <br>
    14. Using the DNA ladder in the first lane as a guide , you can infer the size of the DNA in your sample lanes.
  </p>
  <h4>Gel Extraction</h4>
  <h5>Procedure :</h5>
  <p>
    1. Once you have run your gel, move it to an open UV box, remove it from any gel tray as plastic will block much of the UV and with a clean, sterile razor blade, slice the desired DNA fragment from the gel. <br>
    2. Place the gel in a labeled microfuge tube. <br>
    3. Using a scale, weigh the gel fragment because it is directly proportional to its liquid volume and this is used to determine how much of each buffer to add during the DNA isolation step. <br>
    4. Add 200 μL Binding Buffer (NTI) per 100 mg gel. <br>
    5. Incubate the mixture at 50ºC for 5-10 minutes or until the gel has completely melted. <br>
    6. Add the above mix to a EZ column and let it sit for 2 min, and centrifuge at 11, 000 x g for 30s at room temperature. <br>
    7. Discard liquid and add 750  μL of wash buffer and centrifuge at 10000 rpm for 2min. <br>
    8. Repeat the step twice and discard the flow-through liquid and re-use the collection tube. <br>
    9. Place the EZ column into a clean 1.5 mL eppendorf tube. Add 15-30 μL of Elution Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) directly onto the column matrix and incubate at room temperature for 1 minute. Centrifuge for 1 minute at 11,000 x g to elute DNA.
