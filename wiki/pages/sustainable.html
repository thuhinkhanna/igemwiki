  Sustainability is one of the core values and major aims of Curcoli. One of our major concerns is the ongoing growth of heavy metal toxicity among human beings, flora and fauna and the environment. Our central goal is to address these issues by promoting sustainability and addressing these shortcomings. Our aim is to promote enough awareness among people, especially people working in places like sewages, mines, factories that deal with heavy metals regularly. Our focus will be primarily towards good health and wellness, clean water and sanitation, life below water and Industry and innovation and infrastructure.

<h4 style="margin-top: 2em;">Sustainable Development Goals 3: Promoting good health and well-being</h4>

<p>
  The National Organization of Rare Diseases (NORD) has classifies the long term exposure to cadmium as a cause of concern because of the disruptive nature of cadmium. Cadmium is known to cause liver, lung and kidney failure. During extreme exposures, it can cause cancers. Cadmium is found in multiple day-to-day products including electroplating, storage batteries,   and vapor lamps and in some solders. Limited exposure possesses no harm but cadmium is also found in cigarettes, in fact almost 10% of cigarettes contain cadmium. Continuous and long term smoking can lead to lung diseases, lung and oral cancer and various heart diseases. Certain foods like shellfish, oysters, meat and kidneys of animals have been found to possess huge amounts of Cadmium. A study published in the <i>Environmental Health Perspectives</i>, was conducted by researchers at USC, the University of Michigan, and the University of Washington, this study concluded that cadmium was more difficult to excrete. In fact cadmium, over a period of time starts to accumulate and cause havoc in organs.

  Our primary goal is to promote healthy and happy living by raising awareness. Most of the heavy metals are released into water bodies. These heavy metals are absorbed by the flora and fauna in these water bodies. Fishes get affected by heavy metal poisoning and the flora like corals start dying. Most of the fishes are consumed by humans and other animals, this cycle of consumption of heavy metals, directly or indirectly keeps going on and can affect people. Our proposed method aims to reduce the amount of concentration of cadmium in effluents and we are positively hoping that this method can reduce the concentration of cadmium and which can eventually reduce the toxic harm that cadmium causes.

<h4 style="margin-top: 2em;">Sustainable Development Goals 6: Clean water and Sanitation</h4>

<p>
  Clean water and sanitation are basic human rights. It is extremely important that every single person has access to clean water and basic fundamental rights. But the unfortunate fact is that many people do not have access to clean water and as a result develop various health problems. Most of the wastewater treatments do not remove the presence of heavy metals completely, and when this water is consumed for a longer period of time, can cause adverse health effects. It is important for technology to get advanced while performing water treatments that can remove all components that can cause potential harm. The same remains for sewage. Proper sewage treatment is extremely important. A lot of diseases can be spread from ill-management of sewage. Even in todayâ€™s world, practices such as manual scavenging are allowed to continue, which is extremely degrading and more harmful. As science and research moves forward, we are hoping that practices such as manual scavenging are completely stopped. Clean water and sanitation are a major part of human rights and no one should be deprived of those. The policies and initiatives of the government may lead to direct impact on wastewater management, and this eventually could affect the overall condition of society. Wastewater and sanitation could be considered interrelated to each other, as sanitation is the process that mitigates the potential risks and harms caused to humans through wastewater.

<h4 style="margin-top: 2em;">Sustainable Development Goals 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</h4>

<p>
  The development and progress of a country especially in terms of the economy depends on the growth of its Industries, infrastructure, and promotion of innovation in different technological services. When it comes to industry, infrastructure, and innovation in the water industry, several advancements are taking place in the treatment of wastewater. People and many global enterprises including government agencies are starting to invest in the manufacture of different tools and techniques that will aid in the development of new waste water management technology. One such example is the advancement in cutting edge tech like microbial fuel cells for simultaneous wastewater and electricity generation. This SDG aims to ensure technological progress in various countries to present solutions for the challenges they are facing in accordance with the economic and environmental issues. Our hopes are mainly towards inventing and contributing to the invention of new technology that can help eradicate the presence of all heavy metals and toxic substances present in wastewater effluents and thus helping people lead a happy and healthy life.

  Sustainable Development Goals 14: Life below water 
</h4>

<p>
  The aquatic life under our water bodies make up a huge percentage of life. This aquatic life can consist of various marine fishes, sharks & whales, marine plants and other organisms. With this polluted wastewater being released into water bodies, it can drastically alter the ecological conditions of that water body and affect the overall behavior of the life sustained by it. As human beings, it is our responsibility to ensure that our treasured marine life is protected from any type of activity that can create a negative impact. Though filtration and current treatment methods of wastewater exist, they seem to not remove all the harmful chemicals and heavy metals that seem to create the negative balance. Thus arises a need for innovation to arise and develop technologies using various elements pertaining to science to help develop advancements that can safely remove all harmful agents and not damage the marine life and environment.
